# Correctness-and-the-Loop-Invariant-ALGO

This code implements Insertion Sort on an integer array. It iterates through the array, shifting elements greater than the current value to the right, and inserts the current value in its correct position. After sorting the entire array, it prints the sorted array in a single line.
